# FireDetectNet

FireDetectNet is an deep learning project that focuses on fire detection in images using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This repository provides a comprehensive solution for training, evaluating, and deploying a robust fire detection model. My goal is to contribute to fire safety and emergency response efforts by automating the process of identifying fires in images. Whether you're interested in fire prevention or monitoring, FireDetectNet offers a powerful tool for image-based fire detection.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a custom-designed CNN architecture for accurate fire detection.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances model robustness with data augmentation techniques.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Includes scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance.
- **Sample Images:** Provides sample images for quick model testing.
- **Visualization:** Offers tools to visualize training progress and model performance.
- **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the trained model into your applications for real-time fire detection.
